golang-github-prometheus-client-model (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  DEPRECATION NOTICE

  Starting with v2.0.0, the Prometheus server does not ingest the
  protobuf-based exposition format anymore. Currently, all but one of the
  official instrumentation libraries do not expose the protobuf-based
  exposition format. The Go instrumentation library, however, has been built
  around the protobuf-based data model. As a byproduct thereof, it is still
  able to expose the protobuf-based exposition format. The Go instrumentation
  library is the only remaining repository within the Prometheus GitHub org
  directly using the prometheus/client_model repository.

  Therefore, formerly existing support for languages other than Go (namely
  C++, Java, Python, Ruby) has been removed from this package.
